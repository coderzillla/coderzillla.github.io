<h1>a interview with a guy who knows waves (transcript) </h1>
<h2>(reporter) hello sir can you tell us about your reaserch</h2>
<h2>(the guy) yes what will you like to know</h2>
<h2>(reporter) well  what about color what do waves have to do with color </h2>
<h2> (the guy )well lets examine the light first</h2>

<h2>(the guy) well color of a light wave come from frequency how many waves are there in a second for intance the less wave it will be red when there more waves it wil be purple thats why stoplights are red they move faster cause less frequency  means it wont bump into mattter in the air</h2>
<h2> (reporter) ok what if i want green</h2>
<h2> (the guy) well you will have a medium amount of waves</h2>
<h2>(reporter) oh ok what does frequency do for sound waves since there is no color of sound</h2>
<h2>(the guy) well it affects the  pitch high amount of waves higher pitch low waves low pitch like a opera singer would have a high frequency when singing high</h2>

<h2> (reporter)  what about brightness like why are somethings brighter than other </h2>
<h2>(the guy) well that is amplitude the height of the waves an exapmle would be the brightest thing we know the sun the light waves from the sun or very bright sources would have very tall waves while something like a flashlight waves would not be as tall</h2>

<h3> a photo of a wave with medium ampltiude</h3>
<h2> (reporter) what about sound</h2>
<h2> (the guy) well ampltiude of sound is volume like a speaker at full volume would have a very tall sound wave coming  out of it while a whisper would have a short wave </h2>
<h2>(reporter)i remeber you said that there is something that is the oposite of frequency </h2>
<h2>(the guy) yes wave length is the opposite of frequency its the  size in betwenn the waves when we measure them. By the way we measure them in a second</h2>

<h4>the wave length is top of wave to other top (crest) and bottom to bottom(trough) </h4>


<h2> (reporter) oh ok but i heard you say that there a 2 types of wave is that true</h2>
<h2> (the guy) well yes one that  does not need matter a electro magnetic wave and one that does a mechanical wave  </h2>

<h4> the blue is the elctro part with the red part magnetic</h4>

<h2> (reporter) what about the thing the waves do when they touch things </h2>
<h2>(the guy ) those are called interactions absorsption reflection rafraction and transmisson some transmission example is a lamp for light a speaker for sound  aborpiton well evrything absorps but bla ck abrops light the best and a wall can abrop sound rafraction is interesting because thats just  the speed of the wave changing </h2>
<h2>(reporter) oh speaking about speed is that not part of a wave like frequency etc</h2>

<h2> (the guy) oh yeah speed is wave length  x frequency </h2>

<h2> ( reporter) ok go back to what you said about interaction  </h2> 

<h2> (the guy) all right rafraction i just when the wave goes thourgh some matter and goes to another for instance if i speak the sound will go slower cause of more space out particles but when it hits a wall the speech will go fatser more closed matter to jump of bu for light it is reverse if i shine a flashlight it will go faster in the air the particles are out of its way but when it goes through a window the glass will slow it down cause the glass particles get in the way oh and transmission is just making the sound/light like a speaker or a flash light </h2>
<h2>(reporter) that all  thank you</h2>
<h2>(the guy) your welcome </h2>
<h2> the end</h2>
